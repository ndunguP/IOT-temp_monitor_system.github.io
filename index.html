<h2>About</h2>
<p>This project was inspired by my desire to create a system that would allow me to monitor the temperature of my home from anywhere. I wanted to be able to see if the temperature was getting too high or too low, and I wanted to be able to get alerts if there was a problem.</p>
<p>The project took me about 3 months to complete. I used a variety of technologies, including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
<p>The project is still under development, but I am happy with the progress I have made so far. I am excited to continue working on the project and to make it even better.</p>
